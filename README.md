Pixel Art Maker - Udacity

What Will I Build?
Youâ€™ll build a single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas! Check out this example:

You'll be given starter code, including HTML and CSS, to build the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!
